## Controller >> Services>>Repositories
The client sends an HTTP request to a specific endpoint defined in the controller class.
The controller class receives the request, performs any necessary validation or transformation of the input data.
The controller then delegates the request to the corresponding method in the service class.
The service class performs the required business logic, which may include additional validations, transformations, or other operations.
The service class utilizes the methods defined in the repository interface to interact with the MongoDB database.
The repository interface communicates with the MongoDB database and performs the requested CRUD operations or queries.
The repository interface returns the results to the service class.
The service class processes the results and prepares a response.
The controller class receives the response from the service class and formats it according to the desired HTTP response format (e.g., JSON).
The controller class sends the HTTP response back to the client.
