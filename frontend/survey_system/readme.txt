First i created react app usin "npx create-react-app survey_system" which create the react app
now How it goes the very first thing starts with index.html
in index.html compiler will find a div tag which has its id as "root" 
so this root has given the functionality in the index.js file 
navigate to index.js will find ReactDOM element it helps to connect the components of the UI 

So now ReactDOM is connected to the App.js file

till now the traversing is ................ index.html>>index.js>>App.js

In App.js, in very simple words it helps to define the structure and behavior of the components of the project.
